## How to Run the Code

Before starting we recommend downloading a python IDE or the anaconda package (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), which contains multiple Python/R platforms for Data Science. The following steps have been developed by Anaconda Prompt

1. Acess to the Anaconda Prompt (Python IDE), you will get the command window 

2. Type: ipython , inmmediately the interactive development enviroment of python will be loaded

3. Change directories to where `euro_currency_converter_V1_01` is saved.

3. Type: the following commands to select the folder where the files are located:

    import os
    
    os.chdir("C:/Users/Wilson/Desktop/hw5") -> this is the address for the folder, if you want to know the address right click on the    folder and select properties. The folder address will be essential as it detects the route to import the file
    
    os.getcwd()

4. Type: import euro_currency_converter_V1_01 as var

5. Type: var.desiredDate(dates) -> the dates value is represented by the string of the date (in the form ''). i.e : '2020-01-10'
